My README thing about myself.

Hello, my name is 🎇🎇Khaleed🎇🎇 amd I'm a artist🎨 who is learning to get better, I also am learning java👨‍💻 so I can get into game develop through software/coding or artistic ability.

My interests in game development🕹 are to make games of course and learn more about the process and get experience by making some myself.

The projects I wish to explore are just general projects like by myself or a team making a game idea we agree on a reality. I also what to learn C#👨‍💻 because it's a used in Unity and thats the current go to game engine.
